<h2><code>preventDefault()</code></h2>
<p>When you click something, a default behavior happens. If it's a link, that behavior is going to where the <code>href</code> points to.</p>
<p><code>event.preventDefault();</code> tells jQuery to <strong>not</strong> do the default behavior: the link doesn't take you anywhere, you stay exactly where you are on the page.</p>
