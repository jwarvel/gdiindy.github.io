            West coast represent now put your hands up! But I will get there. We freak in my jeep, Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo. The boys break their necks try'na to creep a little sneak peek. This is transcendental, on another level, boy, you're my lucky star. The one that got away. If I had a nickel for everytime, I'd own the bank. You say you have to write your rhymes, whatever helps you sleep at night.

            Venice beach and Palm Springs, summertime is everything. I can see the writing on the wall. All this money can't buy me a time machine. You got the finest architecture. What you're hidin' underneath. I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar. Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns. You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine.

            Watch you circle the drain. For you I'll risk it all, all. As I march alone to a different beat. West coast represent now put your hands up! You could travel the world but nothing comes close to the golden coast. I wanna walk on your wave length and be there when you vibrate It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse.

            Boom, boom, boom. Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top. You open my eyes and I'm ready to go, lead me into the light. Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar. Summer after high school when we first met. Barbie's on the barbeque, this a hickie or a bruise? Homeboys bangin' out. All that ass hangin' out.

            It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called. What's up your sleeve, such a tease. Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns. I can feel this light that's inside of me. It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. Someone said you had your tattoo removed. End of the rainbow looking treasure. After a hurricane comes a rainbow. Be your teenage dream tonight. Venice beach and Palm Springs, summertime is everything.

Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans. Wild wild west coast, hese are the girls I love the most. Different DNA, they don't understand you. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies.

            Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. You could've been the greatest. Don't be a shy kinda guy I'll bet it's beautiful. So we hit the boulevard. Warm, wet and wild there must be something in the water. Last Friday night, yeah I think we broke the law, always say we're gonna stop. Talk about our future like we had a clue.
